# BuffNEU - Design Document

## Project Description
BuffNEU is a web application designed to help users track and organize their fitness journeys. Users can log individual workout sessions by recording the date, exercise done, sets, and reps completed, then reviewing their workout history over time to monitor their progress. The application also features an exercise library where users can browse exercises by categories (i.e. muscle groups) and use them to build custom workout routines.  These functions ensure that users can both track what they’ve done and plan what comes next.

## User Personas

### User Persona 1 
Gym Newcomer – Seeking more experience in workout routines and looking for how to begin their workout journey

### User Persona 2
Gym Regular – May already have set workout plans and routines, but is looking for a way to track their progress and see growth/results 

### User Persona 3
Personal Trainer – Professional looking to build plans and routines that can be shared with others. 

## User Stories
- As a user with personal health/workout goals, I want to be able to track what how many reps I’ve done 

- As a user with a sporadic schedule, I want to have dated logs to see how frequently/consistent my workouts have been 

- As a user following a workout plan, I want pre-filled forms to help guide me through my workout goal. 

- As a user who does a range of workouts, I want to be able to save multiple forms based on the type of workout/muscle group I’m targeting. 

- As a user who started the gym a week ago, I want to be able to see what type of exercises I can do for arms so I can work on my arm definition. 

- As a user whose job is a personal trainer, I want to be able to create exercise routines for my trainees so that I can give them a personalized plan that fits their needs. 

- As a user who frequents the gym often, I want to be able be able to build different workout routines so that I can focus on different muscle groups on different days (Mondays are leg days, Wednesday is upper body, etc.) 

- As a user who doesn’t like sticking to a set routine, I want to be able to go in and change my exercise routine (the order, swap out exercises) so that I won’t get bored when I go to the gym.
